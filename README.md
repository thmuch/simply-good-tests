# Simply Good Tests

The code in this repository is the basis for my live coding session "Simply Good Tests – A Practical Approach".

The session is designed for beginners / newcomers, i.e. it deals with the absolute basics of well-structured,
readable and maintainable tests. Advanced topics such as mock and integration tests, TDD schools or similar are
deliberately *not* discussed here.

You can have a look at the implementation and refactoring steps in the Git commit history.
