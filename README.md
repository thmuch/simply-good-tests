# Simply Good Tests

The code in this repository is the result of the live coding session
["Simply Good Tests â€“ A Practical Approach"](https://jaxlondon.com/software-architecture-design/simply-good-testing-a-practical-approach/)
on October 5th at JAX London 2021.

The session is designed for beginners / newcomers, i.e. it deals with the absolute basics of well-structured,
readable and maintainable tests. Advanced topics such as mock and integration tests, TDD schools or similar are
deliberately *not* discussed here.

You'll find the slides for the session [here](https://muchsoft.com/presentations/SimplyGoodTests-JAXLondon-2021.pdf).

You can have a look at the implementation and refactoring steps in the Git commit history.
